# Females in Male Spaces: Examining how female candiates are rapped about and how female rappers rap about political candidates. 
Monica De Loera

## Where and how did I get this data?

I scrolled through Github and found a file titled ’hip-hip-candidate’ as I scanned the data I knew I had to use this. I downloaded the data by clicking ‘raw’ on Github. I then exported the file onto google sheets and it exported seamlessly. I Used google sheets to create pivot tables on everything I talk about below. Some of those tables were copied into Data Wrapper to create beautiful charts. 

Here is a link to the data you can check out yourself! (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/hip-hop-candidate-lyrics/genius_hip_hop_lyrics.csv)

## Why this?
I was inspired after creating a chart that is listed under 'Thought Process' in essence, the tables found that in 2016, there were only 13% lines of rap about Donald Trump that were negative compared to Hilary Clinton, who was at 31%. This project, to some degree, is inspired by [an article by The Guardian]( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/the-dark-side-of-guardian-comments "an article from The Guardian") that discovered female journalists were more likely to receive hate comments than their male counterparts, this was also the case for BIPOC journalists. I predicted that female candidates were more likely to be sexualized and referred to negatively. I wanted to see which candidates were sexualized. Again this is inspired by The Guardian's article which talks about groups from marginalized groups of acquiring more hate, because of this I considered Ben Carson, a black candidate, but he only had one lyric which was positive. This made me consider that it must be because rap is a pretty diverse genre, except when it comes to gender. Rap is notorious for being an exclusionary space for women, because of this I chose to look at female rappers and examine if they are being critical of political candidates. Do they hold strong political opinions in their lyrics?

## What I found

Below you can see in which tone each presidential candidate was rappped about (Under thought process)

## Conclusions
I was surprised to find that female artists were more likely to maintain neutral or positve stances. Overall I thought all the data I found was really interesting, I think it was very telling to look at gender when comparing the stance and genre's. I was very surprised that Hilary and Trump were the only candidates that were written about in this theme. I also was surprised to find that even when Trump was sung about under the theme of sex, it was neutral, while with Hilary it was mostly a negative context.I also think it's intresting in general that no other presidential candiate was rapped about in a sexual context. 


## Complete Thought Process

Below is my complete thought process including graphs I made that helped me come up with my question.

I was a bit overwhelmed I know a lot about some of these rappers. I looked through the data and came up with hundreds of questions. Which rappers were most likely to rap negativeley about political candidates. How were rappers who also happened to be future presidential candidates (Kanye) likely to rap about political candidates, did these results correlate with his current political stance? I still think this is a great question however I only had 4 lines of data to work with. I tried to expand on this question by examining how billionaire rappers (Kanye and Jay Z) rapped about political candidates. As much as I love these questions there is not enough data. Spoiler alert Jay Z and Kanye rap about Trump is a positive light highlighting his wealth. The data was predictable, at least for me, and I wanted to challenge myself by revealing something that I didn’t already go in knowing.

After this, I wanted to compare Trump’s reception in the rap world before and after his presidency. This was inspired by artists like Mac Miller who have songs referring to Trump in a positive light, but later went on to highly criticize him in interviews. I’ve noticed in general Trump used to signify wealth, but has now become a symbol of bigotry, racism, and stupidity (rightfully so).For those who might be curious I included some graphs below.
